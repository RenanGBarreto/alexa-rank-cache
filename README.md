# Alexa Rank Cache

We use the Alexa.com Rank Top 1M file in order to build a cache in memory.
The cache is indexed by Rank and by domain name.

NOTE: This class will download and index the Alexa.com top 1M rank once it is loaded. This means that it can add a few seconds delay on the software load time.
